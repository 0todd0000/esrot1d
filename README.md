### Effect size rules of thumb for one-dimensional functional data

<br>
<br>

This is a project repository associated with the following paper:

Pataky TC, Pini A, Preatoni E, Schelin L (2026) Effect size rules of thumb for one-dimensional functional data with an application to gait analysis. *Statistics in Medicine*, in review.

⚠️  The attached **esrot1d** code is NOT on a managed Python package index like PyPI because this code is not comprehensive, and is instead meant primarily to reproduce the results of the paper above. In particular, only simple one-sample and two-sample designs are currently supported; **effect size interpretations are NOT supported for arbitrary data scenarios**.  A more comprehensive package --- supporting other effect sizes and other experiment designs --- may emerge in the future but may be housed in a separate repository.
